# Flask Login System
This is a simple login system built with HTML, Python, and Flask. The system allows users to enter their username and password in order to access a dashboard page. The system uses a blue-grey color theme to create a modern and stylish interface.

### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Install the necessary dependencies by running pip install flask in the project directory.

### Usage
Once the Flask development server is running, open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see the login page of the Blue-Grey Login System. Enter a valid username and password to access the dashboard page.

The dashboard page displays a welcome message with the user's username. From the dashboard, users can navigate to other pages using the links in the navigation bar.
